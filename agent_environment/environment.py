class Environment(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for environment context manager.

    Environment manages the lifecycle of shared resources (file_operator, shell, resources)
    that can be reused across multiple AgentContext sessions.

    Subclasses should:
    - Call super().__init__() to initialize the resource registry
    - Implement _setup() to create file_operator, shell, and any custom resources
    - Implement _teardown() to clean up environment-specific resources
    - Optionally populate self._toolsets in _setup() to provide environment-specific tools
    - NOT override __aenter__ or __aexit__ (use _setup/_teardown instead)

    The base class handles:
    - Calling _setup() in __aenter__
    - Binding resource registry to environment (so factories can access infrastructure)
    - Calling resources.restore_all() after _setup() for resumable resources
    - Calling _teardown() then resources.close_all() in __aexit__

    Resource Factory Pattern:
        Factories receive the Environment instance, allowing access to infrastructure:

        ```python
        async def create_browser(env: Environment) -> BrowserSession:
            return BrowserSession(
                file_operator=env.file_operator,  # Access file system
                shell=env.shell,                   # Execute commands
                tmp_dir=env.tmp_dir,               # Temporary storage
            )

        async with LocalEnvironment() as env:
            env.resources.register_factory("browser", create_browser)
            browser = await env.resources.get_or_create("browser")
        ```

    Resumable Resources:
        Environment supports resource state persistence via ResourceRegistry.
        Resources implementing ResumableResource can have their state exported
        and restored across process restarts.

        Example:
            # First run
            async with LocalEnvironment() as env:
                env.resources.register_factory("browser", create_browser)
                browser = await env.resources.get_or_create("browser")
                # ... use browser ...
                state = env.export_resource_state()
                save_state(state)

            # Subsequent run
            state = load_state()
            async with LocalEnvironment(
                resource_state=state,
                resource_factories={"browser": create_browser},
            ) as env:
                # Browser automatically restored with previous state
                browser = env.resources.get("browser")

    Example:
        Using AsyncExitStack (recommended for dependent contexts):

        ```python
        from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

        async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
            env = await stack.enter_async_context(
                LocalEnvironment(allowed_paths=[Path("/workspace")])
            )
            ctx = await stack.enter_async_context(
                AgentContext(env=env)
            )
            # Get combined toolsets from environment and resources
            toolsets = env.get_toolsets()
            agent = Agent(..., toolsets=[*core_toolsets, *toolsets])
            ...
        # Resources cleaned up when stack exits
        ```
